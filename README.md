unit 3 balloon game. 

I spoke to you in one of the clinics about spacebar not working and you told me to comment it here. My code is good i checked it, it even works on unity but it only doesn't work on webgl/github. 

I made the spacebar work, it is working but you have to hold it, the speed is slower then it shows in unity.
